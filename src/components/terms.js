                    <ul>

                        <li>being exorcised from your haunting grounds because you shared the secret desire that is keeping you bound to the world of the living, thus enabling a psychic, medium, priest, group of teenagers and their dog, or anyone else to force you to vacate the premises</li>
                        <li>being established among the living as actually dead, and not just missing</li>
                        <li>losing your will to after-live</li>
