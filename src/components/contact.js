      <b>Gypsy:</b> Wispy smoke followed by three swirls (crystal ball), or tea leaves in the shape of a goat<br/><br/>
      <b>Phone:</b> Let it dial itself.<br/><br/>
      <b>Psychic/Medium:</b> We're somebody who you never knew in life. Perhaps? Maybe starts with an S? Okay, how about G? G, okay, and you want to tell us something. No, you want us to tell you something? Oh, okay, both. Let's... hmm. Maybe email would be faster.
