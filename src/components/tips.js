        <h1>Dating Tips for the Dead</h1>
        <h2>Safety</h2>
        Meeting new people online can be a fantastic, fun experience. Of foremost concern, however, is safety, because meeting strangers can also be dangerous. If you're alive.<br/><br/>
        Thank goodness <i>you're</i> not, eh? What's the worst a psycho could do to you? You can't come to <i>any</i> bodily harm, because you don't have a body! Hurray for being dead! Am I right? <br/><br/>
        What this means is, no matter how chancy a potential hookup might seem, you have <strong>absolutely nothing to worry about!</strong> Take that, the living!
        <h2>Etiquette</h2>
        By now you've learned that your fellow phantoms come from many eras; some may be hundreds of years old, or more! This means that cultural standards will vary widely; what may have been taboo in your generation might be the norm in the one a few generations from now.<br/><br/>
        It would be impossible to list the details of every culture throughout all time, but there are some behaviors that are universally approved -- and others that are universally disliked. Here's a quick primer.
        <ul><li><b>Ask questions.</b> Get to know your date. How did he or she die? What was it like to stand over their own lifeless corpse? Did they see a light at the end of a tunnel, and if so, why didn't they go towards it? You may find you have a lot in common.
        </li><li><b>Compliment your date.</b> Are they looking ghastly? Particularly eldritch? Be sure to let them know! 
        </li><li><b>Don't kiss on the first date.</b> Don't kiss ever, in fact, because your faces just pass through each other, and it's really weird for both parties.
        </li><li><b>Don't be offended if they suddenly disappear.</b> You should know as well as anyone that existence in this twilight realm can be inconsistent. If your date vanishes, don't be too quick to judge. 
        </li></ul>
        <h2>The Living</h2>
        Worried what your loved ones you left behind might think of your new dating life? <b>Don't!</b> They're probably far more worried what you think of <em>their</em> lives, which, in fact, are probably disgraceful. If you go check on them right now, odds are (at least with the current generation) that they're just sitting in front of a computer screen, surfing the internet. You could probably stand right behind them, breath cold air down their necks, and they'd hardly notice.
        <h2>Have Fun!</h2>
        Life after death doesn't have to be just endless nights of roaming around, clanking ethereal chains, moaning about vengeance. As they say in the current generation, get a life! Or as we prefer to say, get an afterlife!<br/><br/><br/>
