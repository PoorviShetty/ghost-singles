      <h1>Privacy</h1>
        We understand that just because you float around in nothing but your nightgown night after night <em>doesn't mean</em> you want anything less than total privacy.<br/><br/>
        That's why we won't give away your personal information. We won't disclose your address or haunting grounds, so don't worry. You also don't need to sweat (not that you could) about us being hacked, and you losing your social security number; first, we don't collect your social security number, and second, your number has probably already been stolen in order to give some punk a new identity.<br/><br/>
        So what are you worried about? Start dating! Find love! Make a little romance!*
