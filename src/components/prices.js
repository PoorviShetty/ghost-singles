        Uh-oh! Forgot to "take it with you," eh? Or maybe spent your last dime paying the ferryman?<br/><br/>No worries! GhostSingles.com is <b>100% free!*</b><br/><br/>
        The way we see it, finances probably aren't a big concern for most of our customers. They're probably enjoying not having to worry about how to come up with next month's rent. Why, then, should we give them something to worry about by demanding payment for our quality services?<br/><br/>
        To date, there are no other dating sites for singles who have passed on. We could use this to form a dominant monopoly on the ghost-singles market, but that's not the way we work. We're just trying to provide a service. We hope you enjoy it.
